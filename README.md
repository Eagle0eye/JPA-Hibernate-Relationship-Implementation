# JPA-Hibernate-Relationship-Implementation
Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java applications. It provides a way to manage relationships between entities using annotations. Below is an explanation of the types of relationships used in your code along with simple steps to implement them.

# JPA Relationships

how Types of Relationships

### 1. **One-to-One Relationship**

A one-to-one relationship means that one entity is associated with exactly one other entity.

#### Example:

The `Employee` entity has a one-to-one relationship with the `Address` entity.

#### Code:

```java
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
private Address address;
```

#### Steps:

1. Annotate the field in one entity with `@OneToOne`.
2. Use `@JoinColumn` to specify the foreign key in the owning entity.

---

### 2. **One-to-Many Relationship**

A one-to-many relationship means that one entity is associated with multiple other entities.

#### Example:

The `Department` entity has a one-to-many relationship with the `Employee` entity.

#### Code:

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
private List<Employee> employees;
```

#### Steps:

1. Annotate the collection field in the parent entity with `@OneToMany`.
2. Use `mappedBy` to reference the field that owns the relationship in the child entity.
3. In the child entity, annotate the owning field with `@ManyToOne`.

---

### 3. **Many-to-One Relationship**

A many-to-one relationship means that many entities are associated with one other entity.

#### Example:

The `Employee` entity has a many-to-one relationship with the `Department` entity.

#### Code:

```java
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
private Department department;
```

#### Steps:

1. Annotate the field in the child entity with `@ManyToOne`.
2. Use `@JoinColumn` to specify the foreign key.

---

### 4. **Many-to-Many Relationship**

A many-to-many relationship means that multiple entities can be associated with multiple other entities.

#### Example:

The `Employee` entity has a many-to-many relationship with the `Mission` entity.

#### Code:

```java
@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(
    name = "empl",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "mission_id")
)
private List<Mission> missions;
```

#### Steps:

1. Annotate the collection field in both entities with `@ManyToMany`.
2. Use `@JoinTable` in one entity to define the join table.
3. Specify `joinColumns` and `inverseJoinColumns` to indicate the foreign keys.
4. Use `mappedBy` in the non-owning entity to refer back to the owning side.

## Summary of Entities in the Code

1. **Address**:

   - Represents an employee's address.
   - Has a one-to-one relationship with `Employee`.

2. **Department**:

   - Represents a department in the organization.
   - Has a one-to-many relationship with `Employee`.

3. **Employee**:

   - Represents an employee.
   - Has relationships with `Address`, `Department`, and `Mission`.

4. **Mission**:

   - Represents a task or assignment.
   - Has a many-to-many relationship with `Employee`.

5. **EmployeeRole**:

   - Enum defining roles like `ADMIN`, `STAFF`, and `SUPERVISOR`.

## General Steps for JPA Relationships

1. **Define Entities**:

   - Use `@Entity` and `@Table` annotations to define database tables.

2. **Annotate Relationships**:

   - Use relationship annotations such as `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, or `@ManyToMany`.

3. **Specify Join Columns**:

   - Use `@JoinColumn` or `@JoinTable` as necessary.

4. **Configure Database**:

   - Use `hibernate.cfg.xml` or application properties to connect to the database.

5. **Persist Entities**:

   - Use `EntityManager` or Spring Data JPA repositories to persist and retrieve data.

---

## Example Application

To test the relationships, you can use a Spring Boot application with the following steps:

1. Create repositories for the entities using Spring Data JPA.

   ```java
   public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Integer> {}
   public interface DepartmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Department, Integer> {}
   public interface MissionRepository extends JpaRepository<Mission, Integer> {}
   public interface AddressRepository extends JpaRepository<Address, Integer> {}
   ```

2. Add data to the database via service classes or a CommandLineRunner.

3. Fetch and verify the relationships using JPA queries.

Following these steps, you can effectively use JPA relationships to model and manage complex entity associations in your Java application.
